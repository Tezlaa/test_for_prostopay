# Technical task:
```
task 1:

    Implement own hashmap class (put, get methods are required).
    write tests for this class.
    add notes with argumentation for choosen implementation.

task 2:
    Write small service class with methods
    get(user_id) â†’ UserDTO
    add(user: UserDTO)

    signatures can be changed if you think it's needed for better implementation

    UserDTO - pydantic model
    users are stored in db.
    assume you have method get_async_session, which returns AsyncSession sqlalchemy object to interact with db

    write tests for that class.
    
    add notes with argumentation for choosen implementation.
